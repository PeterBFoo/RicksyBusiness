### Rick wants to set a party, so let's make an app and make it *true*

When someone arrives to the party, It's registered in the receptive class of the system using his CreditCard.

The receptive charges in the CreditCard:

- The cost of the UFOUber, getting them back home.
- The cost of the welcome pack.
- The component of the reservation of the UFOs and the delivery component of the welcome's pack observes the receptive component, so when the receptive registers a guest, It has to charge automatically to the guest's CreditCard the cost of both services.

**Here's the UML diagram: **
